Why are you interested in taking DATA602?

I am particularly interested in taking DATA602 because my masters program is in Data Science. DATA602 is the base for that. I am excited to learn all the steps of Data Science Lifecycle in detail and equip myself with the knowledge and skills needed to build a Data Science Project solving real life problems. After reading the syllabus and course outcomes of DATA602, I am sure that I will get enough resources and insights into starting off my journey of exploring the field of Data Science.
